due to bug:
  * https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10521
  * http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-11190

it's not possible to have Portrait and Stackedwindow at the same time


For next major release 0.2.0:
* DONE pre choose the 2nd landguage as question language
* DONE in MC mode change the showing of failed on OK status msg
  the way it is atm is not that good...
* DONE flash card mode (portrait and landscape)
* DONE enhanded Litner Box algorithm, not just random asking
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard
  maybe also some ideas from Parley can be used:
  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdeedu/parley/

For next major release 0.3.0:
* enable support for images in library and use it in flash card mode (show image with question or just image)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line368
* support for kvtml multiple choice feature, fallback to random if not specified
* reset option for the grades
  if the grade for all entries is >=7 then the Leitner Box system doesn't work anymore...
* from: http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/querymee/
  # a really neccessary feature would be a lineedit where you can type in the word.
  # it should be implemented very easy. you just have to compare the input string
  # with the value of the flashcard.

itmes for the fare future:
* enable support for sound (any idea how to use the sound?!)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line376

  kvtml allows URLs and local path images and sound tags, KDE library returns KUrl, not the same as QUrl!
  handler for download is needed and handler to check if file already locally available!

* possibility to chose "all" for lessons
* multiple choice with conjucated verbs - does that make sense?
* multiple choice with comparison forms adjectives/adverbs. - does that make sense?
* enable other file formats than kvtml in library (vocwql, vocxdxf, pauker) 
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qmvocdocument.cpp#line290
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocwqlreader.cpp
   -> http://peterandlinda.com/wordquiz/vocabularies/ .wql files
   -> no files available anymore, but wordquiz which writes kvtml files -> help file
   -> skip ?!
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocxdxfreader.cpp
   -> http://xdxf.revdanica.com/down/ .xdxf files
   -> this allows mulitlines which leads to empty entries !
   -> skip ?!
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocpaukerreader.cpp
   -> http://pauker.sourceforge.net/pauker.php?page=lessons&lang=en  pauker files
   -> these files are gzipped -> handler or in doku mention to gzip -d
   -> makes for each entry a new Lesson!
