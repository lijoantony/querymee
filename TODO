due to bug:
  * https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10521
  * http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-11190

it's not possible to have Portrait and Stackedwindow at the same time

For next release 0.1.X:
* update help file for .csv files
* update help file where to get vokabeln http://www.vokabeln.de/v1/download.htm
  (just Version 1 works!)
* DONE support for csv files in library
       http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvoccsvreader.cpp
       http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvocdocument.cpp#line342
* DONE enable vokabeln reader
       http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocvokabelnreader.cpp


For next major release 0.2.0:
* possibility to chose "all" for lessons
* flash card mode (portrait and landscape)
* enable support for images in library and use it in flash card mode (show image with question or just image)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line368
* enable support for sound (any idea how to use the sound?!)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line376

  kvtml allows URLs and local path images and sound tags, KDE library returns KUrl, not the same as QUrl!
  handler for download is needed and handler to check if file already locally available!
* support for kvtml multiple choice feature, fallback to random if not specified


itmes for the fare future:
* enhanded Litner Box algorithm, not just random asking
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard
  maybe also some ideas from Parley can be used:
  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdeedu/parley/
* multiple choice with conjucated verbs
* multiple choice with comparison forms adjectives/adverbs.
* enable other file formats than kvtml in library (vocwql, vocxdxf, pauker) 
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qmvocdocument.cpp#line290
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocwqlreader.cpp
   -> http://peterandlinda.com/wordquiz/vocabularies/ .wql files
   -> no files available anymore, but wordquiz which writes kvtml files -> help file
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocxdxfreader.cpp
   -> http://xdxf.revdanica.com/down/ .xdxf files
   -> this allows mulitlines which leads to empty entries !
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/trees/master/lib/qmvocpaukerreader.cpp
   -> http://pauker.sourceforge.net/pauker.php?page=lessons&lang=en  pauker files
   -> these files are gzipped -> handler or in doku mention to gzip -d
* from: http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/querymee/
  # a really neccessary feature would be a lineedit where you can type in the word.
  # it should be implemented very easy. you just have to compare the input string
  # with the value of the flashcard.
