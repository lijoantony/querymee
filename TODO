due to bug:
  * https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10521
  * http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-11190

it's not possible to have Portrait and Stackedwindow at the same time


For next major release 2.0.0:
* possibility to chose "all" for lessons
* flash card mode (portrait and landscape)
* enable support for images in library and use it in flash card mode (show image with question or just image)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line368
* enable support for sound (any idea how to use the sound?!)
  is deactivated at the moment
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvockvtml2reader.cpp#line376

  kvtml allows URLs and local path images and sound tags, KDE library returns KUrl, not the same as QUrl!
  handler for download is needed and handler to check if file already locally available!
* support for kvtml multiple choice feature, fallback to random if not specified
* support for csv files in library
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvoccsvreader.cpp
  http://gitorious.org/querymee/querymee/blobs/master/lib/qtvtvocdocument.cpp#line342


itmes for the fare future:
* enhanded Litner Box algorithm, not just random asking
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard
  maybe also some ideas from Parley can be used:
  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdeedu/parley/
* multiple choice with conjucated verbs
* multiple choice with comparison forms adjectives/adverbs.
* enable other file formats than kvtml in library (vocwql, vocxdxf, pauker, vokabeln)

  # a really neccessary feature would be a lineedit where you can type in the word.
  # it should be implemented very easy. you just have to compare the input string
  # with the value of the flashcard.
